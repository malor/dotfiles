# Collection of dotfiles

The only interesting thing about this collection is Neovim's configuration borrowed from
[@ikalnytskyi](https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/dotfiles).

# Usage

Create a symlink in your home directory for each configuration that you want to use, e.g.:

```shell
$ stow -t ~/ nvim
```
